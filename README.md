# AA Game

A minimal, fast, and faithful recreation of the classic mobile game **aa**â€”shoot pins into a spinning wheel without colliding with anything already attached. Built with Java (JavaFX) and packaged with Maven.

---

## Features

- **Arcade-tight gameplay:** click/tap to fire pins; avoid collisions to clear the level  
- **Deterministic spin logic:** predictable yet tense difficulty curve  
- **Level configuration:** number of pins, initial angles, spin speed, and direction  
- **Responsive rendering:** JavaFX scene graph with CSS styling  
- **Clean project layout:** standard Maven + `src/main/java` organization

> If youâ€™re new to the game: a central circle spins; you have **N** pins to shoot. Land every pin without touching others to win the level.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

Typical level knobs (check the level/config classes):

- **`pinsCount`** â€“ total pins the player must stick  
- **`spinSpeed`** â€“ degrees per second (may reverse or vary per level)  
- **`spinDirection`** â€“ clockwise / counter-clockwise  
- **`initialAngles`** â€“ pre-placed pins for challenge setups  
- **`failOnCollision`** â€“ boolean collision rule (usually `true`)
